# Logistic Regression

## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. This repository provides an overview of Logistic Regression along with examples and implementations in Python.


## How Logistic Regression Works

Logistic Regression models the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function).

### Logistic Function (Sigmoid):

P(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

where:
- P(y=1|x) is the probability that the outcome y is 1 given the input features x.
- z is the linear combination of the input features and their corresponding coefficients.

### Model Training:
1. **Parameter Initialization**: Initialize the coefficients (weights) and the intercept (bias) of the logistic regression model.
2. **Model Training**: Use optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) to minimize the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) and optimize the model parameters.
3. **Prediction**: Given new input features, use the trained model to predict the probability of the binary outcome belonging to class 1.

## Key Concepts in Logistic Regression

- **Binary Classification**: Logistic Regression is primarily used for binary classification tasks, where the target variable has two possible outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam, fraudulent or non-fraudulent).
- **Log Odds Ratio**: The logarithm of the odds ratio (logit function) is used to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the binary outcome.

## Advantages of Logistic Regression

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Provides probabilistic interpretations of predictions.
- Efficient for large datasets and computationally inexpensive to train.
- Robust to noise and outliers.

## Limitations of Logistic Regression

- Assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of the outcome.
- Limited to binary classification tasks and cannot be directly applied to multi-class classification problems.
- Sensitive to outliers and may underperform when the classes are highly imbalanced.

## Applications of Logistic Regression

- Spam detection in email filtering.
- Credit risk assessment in finance.
- Medical diagnosis and disease prediction.
- Customer churn prediction in marketing.
- Fraud detection in cybersecurity.
